MapGive
================
## Description

This repository contains the contents of the MapGive website accessible at [https://mapgive.state.gov](https://mapgive.state.gov).

## Installation

These installation instructions are subject to change.

Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) needs to be installed.

Now you can run the commands below to install the other dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node #grunt expects "node"

sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
sudo apt-get install optipng
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-progs
```
Navigate to the Mapgive directory. The first time run 'npm install' to install the grunt dependencies. Also run 'bundle install' to install the ruby dependencies from the gem file.

## Usage

From now on you can build the site by running the 'grunt' command inside of the Mapgive directory. Grunt outputs the site in the '_site' folder. You can also run the site locally by running 'jekyll serve'.
