In recent months, Lake Victoria has experienced rising water levels that have caused significant flooding impacts on the Lake Shoreline communities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda as well as downstream communities near Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert.

This rise has been attributed to adverse climate change effects prolonging the rainfall cycles and has caused significant flooding impacts on the Lakeâ€™s shoreline communities as well as downstream communities near Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert. Shoreline communities and businesses in low-lying areas in Uganda and Kenya have been severely affected, and communities displaced. In addition, infrastructure has been damaged or made inaccessible while crops are being washed away.

Therefore, through mapping, the OpenStreetMap Uganda community and its partners around the world including MapGive, YouthMappers, will be combining efforts to generate data products such as household locations, access road networks, community farmlands, key installations, and maps that will be shared by the intervening organizations, communities, and local governments for planning and response purposes. More so, the data collected will be accessed freely thereby benefitting academia and researchers locally and internationally.
