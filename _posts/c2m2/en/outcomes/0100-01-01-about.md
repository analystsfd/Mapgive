In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, local experts in cities around the world participated in the Cities’ COVID-19 Mitigation Mapping program to use geospatial science to understand second-order impacts of COVID-19 in order to address them. 
</p>
<p>
In one year, participants succeeded in - 
<br>
<ol class="city-list">
        <li>generating local data through participatory mapping activities and</li>
        <li>centering place-based needs due to second-order impacts to contextualize other data derived due to the pandemic (i.e., the country-specific data dashboards tracking COVID cases, deaths, and spread)</li>
</ol>
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex-item-left" style="flex-grow: 1">
    <h3>All hubs actively used geospatial tools for data generation, including</h3>
    <ul class="city-list">
        <li><a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/"> Kobo Toolbox (Africa hub) </a></li>
        <li><a href="http://citiesnavigator.com/"> Cities Navigator (Africa hub) </a></li>
        <li><a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/landing/free-account"> Microsoft Power BI (Latin America hub) </a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/"> QGIS (Asia Hub) </a></li>
        <li>Common to all projects was the use of <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html">ArcGIS</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a> to conduct customized analysis and visualizations. </li>

    <h3>The C2M2 program generated diverse data, including: </h3>
    <ul class="city-list">
        <li><a href="https://mapgive.state.gov/c2m2/#latin-america-hub">real-time crime spatiotemporal data</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://mapgive.state.gov/c2m2/#africa-hub">water and sanitation data</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://mapgive.state.gov/c2m2/#asia-hub">migration data</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://mapgive.state.gov/c2m2/#asia-hub">health facility data, and</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://mapgive.state.gov/c2m2/#latin-america-hub">tourism data</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>


<p>
Most datasets generated from the C2M2 program are uploaded to publicly available platforms (e.g., <a href="https://oepnstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href="https://data.humdata.org/">Humanitarian Data Exchange - HDX</a>) to promote open data governance. 
</p>

<p>
The program created useful dashboards that deliver important COVID-19 relevant information to citizens and policymakers. Water and sanitation accessibility dashboard (Africa hub)
Healthcare accessibility dashboard (Africa and Asia hub), and Crime hot/cold spot information dashboard (Latin America hub).
</p>

<p>
The program produced effective visualization products (e.g., ArcGIS Story Maps and Videos) that highlight the key findings of the projects and communicate with various stakeholders. These products inform decision-making through providing data at the local level that previously did not exist, analyses of existing data, and newly generated data to track COVID-related impacts.

    <h3>Important lessons learned include: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>real-time crime spatiotemporal data </li>
        <li>Identification and collection of new georeferenced data at the sub-city scale (i.e., city districts or neighborhoods). Many of the city projects collected data that had never before been collected, providing new insights for city planning and decision making (i.e., locations of all types of healthcare facilities such as clinics, hospitals, pharmacies) </li>
        <li>The use of geospatial tools, common methods, and standardized data structure (i.e., attributes, units, categories) enable robust analyses across thematic issues. C2M2 projects examined different second-order impacts using common geospatial approaches.  </li>
        <li>Existing data could be enhanced by collecting additional attribute information. For example, characteristics of water points (i.e., private/public, hours of operation) and toilets (i.e., handwashing facilities at location) provided additional information relevant to government policies to manage the pandemic. </li>
        <li>Demonstrating the integration of different methods. Projects used mobile tools to conduct surveys with sample populations with georeferenced locations. </li>
        <li>Protection of personal information and informed consent. Ethics underpin surveys and georeferenced data collection. Georeferenced data reveal sensitive information regarding location and people. Protection of personal information is necessary for data generation and sharing. Ensuring participants understood informed consent while protecting anonymity was essential to all projects. </li>
        <li>Analysis and visualization of geospatial data for decision making. Data can provide the locational analysis to identify place-based solutions (i.e., density analysis of point data to yield “heat maps” of sensitive areas). However, stakeholders and decision-makers need to be aware of the utility of a geospatial approach. Visualizations (data dashboards) and storytelling (Esri Story Maps) are means to demonstrate data results. </li>

            This report is a summary document of the Cities' COVID Mitigation Mapping Program 2020. The pandemic exposed the profound inequalities that are evident around the world but also emphasized the important role of geography – the need to think spatially and be cognizant of the fact that geography matters. The Cities' COVID Mitigation and Mapping (C2M2) Program was a rapid response to identifying the long-term impacts due to COVID-19 to demonstrate how the use of geospatial tools can inform decision-making.

            This webinar focuses on defining second-order impacts and their spatial characteristics. For example, second-order impacts include school closures, changing patterns of mobility and movement due to government restrictions on travel and closed borders, and access to basic services such as health services in informal settlements. Identifying second-order impacts and their spatial aspects is the first step to identifying data needs for data collection and analysis to develop adaptive strategies for data-driven decision-making by local and regional governments.

            This webinar provides a short presentation on experience with data ethics during the pandemic. We have selected panelists from different sectors – non-governmental organizations and academia – to consider data ethics from different perspectives. This discussion will consider how the pandemic has impacted data generation, collection, and analysis with an emphasis on geospatial data and vulnerable populations. Due to the nature of geospatial data, issues related to security, privacy, and confidentiality are particularly challenging. To address these issues, geospatial practitioners and societies have created a code of ethics as well as developed specific analytical methods and techniques to mask sensitive data and ensure anonymity.

            This networking event’s goals were (i) to promote the sustainability of an important ongoing discussion on the secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world and (ii) to build a global network of researchers, policymakers, activists, and citizens who are interested in examining the second-order impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of geospatial analysis. In this online networking event, participants showcased their COVID-19 project in a lightning talk (2-3 mins) format (Figure 16). During the breakout room sessions, participants could find potential collaborators for their future projects.
