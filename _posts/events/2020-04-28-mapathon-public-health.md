The mapathon hosted two speakers focused on how mapping can support epidemiology and policy decision making, and two other speakers who discussed using open data at the local level in support of COVID-19 response and other public health efforts (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and 2C Alum from Douala, Cameroon).  The mapping project focused on the Greater Gaborone area of Botswana; participants added 3600 new buildings to the map and completed about 30% of the project.
