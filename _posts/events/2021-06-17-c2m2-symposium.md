What comes next for the world’s cities after COVID-19? On June 22-25, hear from international experts at the front line of monitoring the pandemic and using spatial data to illuminate critical needs for societies to respond to impacts of COVID-19. Join us for a four-day Cities' COVID Mitigation Mapping (C2M2) Symposium organized with our partners, the American Association of Geographers and Harvard University’s Center for Geographic Analysis.

The C2M2 Symposium will focus on different themes that have emerged from the pandemic:  migration, livelihoods, and gender. We will discuss how the pandemic influences information needs, data sharing, and requirements for long-lasting sustainable projects and partnerships. The fourth day will demonstrate hands-on tools developed by C2M2 partners and collaborators.  Registration is now open. This symposium is free and open to the public.
