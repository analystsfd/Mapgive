Building on the success of the first White House Mapathon in 2015, last week more than 140 mappers participated in this year’s events at the White House and 15 other locations – in seven states and three countries. The mappers used open geographic data to improve mapping in rural areas of the United States, better identify public transit routes to our Nation’s parks, and prioritize malaria prevention projects around the globe. An additional 1,500 people participated via livestream.
