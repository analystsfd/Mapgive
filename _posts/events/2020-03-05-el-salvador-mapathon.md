MapGive and American Spaces in El Salvador are partnering to facilitate volunteer participation in crowdsourced mapping that supports humanitarian assistance and development programs, through 3 concurrent three-hour “Mapathons” at American Spaces in El Salvador, using an innovative PD initiative called MapGive. The Mapathon will be done on March 5th, 2020 to mark the International Women’s Day. Each American Space will have 15 volunteers mapping together for a total of 45 Salvadorans participating in the program.
