The World Bank Open Cities Mapping Project Guide is a tool for practitioners who wish to bring community mapping initiatives to their cities or regions. The guide documents lessons learned from the regional Open Cities Africa program and its predecessors in South Asia to offer best practices on the design and implementation of a community mapping initiative.
